# BabbleChat

## Background and Overview 

**BabbleChat** is a minimal viable product that aims to make learning languages fun by matching language speakers via live chat. Individuals who join are able to choose the languages they want to learn and the languages that they know. They are then matched with a partner that is fluent in the language they are learning, and who is learning the language they are fluent in. For example, the users Greg T. and Mona S. would be matched together:  

Greg T. 
Learning: Japanese
Knows: English, Spanish

Mona S. 
Learning: Spanish
Knows: Japanese

**BabbleChat** is primarily built using MERN Stack, consisting of the following 4 technologies: 

1. MongoDB
2. Express 
3. React
4. Node
